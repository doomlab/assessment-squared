Scale name,Revised University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LSR)
Scale reference,"Russell, D., Peplau, L. A., & Ferguson, M. L. (1978). Development of a measure of loneliness. Journal of Personality Assessment, 42(3), 290–294."
Number of groups compared,Seven
Group names,"18–25, 26–35, 36–45, 46–55, 56–65, 66–75, 76+"
Steps of MI tested,"Equal form (configural), Equal item loadings (metric), Equal item intercepts/means (scalar), Partial scalar invariance"
Order of steps tested,Configural -> Metric -> Scalar
Metric used for MI,"CFI, RMSEA, SRMR"
Rule for MI,CFI difference < 0.01
Invariance claim,Partial scalar invariance for the UCLA-LSR with varying results across item intercepts
